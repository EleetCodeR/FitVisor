# FitVisor
a Machine Learning based In-Browser Fitness assistant based on Human Pose Estimation.

## Abstract :
The goal of this project is to design a system that will assist a person in their fitness-regime in real time by using human pose estimation. Throughout the fitness-regime person’s pose is continuously detected and is assisted in real-time with the help of feedback. For the Pose detection phase, we have used the “Posenet” model provided by Tensorflow-framework and for Pose classification phase, we have trained our own neural network using p5.js and ml5.js JavaScript libraries.
